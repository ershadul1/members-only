# Members Only

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the use of devise gem to handle user authentications in Ruby on Rails.

The project contains a user and a post model. Only registerred users can create posts and see author name of posts. Unregisterred users can only see the post but not the author name of the post.

It follows the tutorial found at the [odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication)

The user interface of this project was inspired by [Andy Leverenz](https://github.com/justalever/twittter)
